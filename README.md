## Final Project
### Overview
This final project is about rock climbing in the USA. In the project, I visualized geographical distribution of outdoor sports climbing routes, how hard can USA climbers climb and how height and weight can influence climbing.
### Data
I got the data from Kaggle. The dataset is created by another rock climbers. He scraped the data from a rock climbing community website 8a.nu where climbers can record their climbing history on it.
