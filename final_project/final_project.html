        <h1>Rock Climbing in USA</h1>
        <p>
            Being in nature is such a wonderful feeling. The peace and tranquility of being on the trail is one of my greatest pleasures, 
            but I need a reward at the end of a hike. I need a magnificent view, a beautiful lake, or an aesthetically pleasing activity to spectate. 
            Yeah, I know, that last one doesnâ€™t really make sense, but if you hike to Red Rock, Joshua Tree, Yosemite, you get to experience all three of the above. 
            This is where I fell in love with rock climbing.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I am really into rock climbing but I still don't have a clear picture about how's the rock climbing trend is like in the USA. To satisfy my curiosity,
            I decided to do visualization for the climbing data in the USA. My visualization can probably show how popular is rock climbing in the USA now and how's
            USA rock climbers performances.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The climbing routes distribution in the USA</h2>
        <div class="d3-geomap" id="map">
            <script src="//unpkg.com/d3@5/dist/d3.min.js"></script>
            <script src="//unpkg.com/topojson@3/dist/topojson.min.js"></script>
            <script src="d3-geomap/d3-geomap.min.js"></script>
            <script src="map.js"></script> 
        </div>
        <p>
            The choropleth map represents the number of sports climbing routes that are logged at <a href="https://www.8a.nu/" target="_blank">8a.nu</a>.
            The darker the color, the more routes having in those areas.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            From the map, we can tell that there are more rock climbing routes in the west coast compared to the east coast. This meets my perception that most of the
            world class climbing areas are in the west such as Yosemite National park in California and Red Rock National Park in Nevada. Midwest is more flat than west
            and east coast and thus there are less climbing areas than other parts of the states.
        </p>

            <div id="bar" class="chart sticky-side">
                <h3 style="text-align:center">How Hard Do People Climb</h2>
                <script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.min.js"></script>
                <script src="bar.js"></script>
            </div>
            <div class="text-container">
                The bar chart on the left shows how many climbers have sent (finished the routes without falling) the routes of that grade that were recorded on  <a href="https://www.8a.nu/" target="_blank">8a.nu</a>. 
                The grade that are sent by the most people is 5.12a which is a hard grade for unprofessional climbers. When the grades getting harder, the number of people sent decreased significantly.
                The routes above 5.14 can almost only be sent by professional climbers.
            </div>
        </section>

        <h2>Climbers by Sex and the Highest Level They Sent</h2>
        <div id="bubble">
            <script src="bubble.js"></script>
        </div>
        <p>
            Each bubble in a bubble chart represents a single climber. Blue ones are male climbers and pink ones are female climbers. The size of the bubble tells the highest grade of sports climbing the climber has achieved.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            From the bubble chart, we can easily tell that the number of male climbers is much more the number of female climbers. Male climbers also can achieve higher grades.
        </p>

        <h2>Relationship between Grade and BMI</h2>
        <div id="box_male">
            <script src="box_male.js"></script>
        </div>
        <div id="box_male">
            <script src="box_female.js"></script>
        </div>
        <p>
           The box plots shows the relationship between highest climbing grade and BMI. Body Mass Index (BMI) is calculated with height and weight. 
           Height and weight are always considered to be major factors that could affect climbers' climbing performances. I want to visualize the relationship 
           between Climbing grades for each climber and their BMI to see whether it truly can affect people's performances.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            There appears to be a downward trend in BMI as the max grade of the climber increases. I think this makes sense as climbing is hard, and to get 
            into the 5.12+ range is difficult. You need to be dedicated and you need to practice. If you are that dedicated to climbing, you are going to have enough willpower.
        </p>
        
        <div id="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Overall, the rock climbing is popular in the USA. From natural resources prospect, west coast has the best climbing routes compared to east coast and midwest.
                Most of the recorded climbers can send grades around 5.12 for sports climbing. Male climbers are much more than female climbers.
                For how to improve the climbing performance, weight control could be one of the solution since lower BMI can in general gives a better grade.

        <div id="process">
            <h2>Process and Challenges</h2>
            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <p>
                As I said before, I am really devoted to rock climbing now, especially interested in outdoor sports climbing. I also had chance to go several outdoor
                rock climbing areas in the USA to try to send some routes. When thinking about this project, I want to do a topic that I have passion about which is rock climbing.
                As a beginnin rock climber, the first thing I'm curious about is which part in the USA have the most and best climbing routes. I also want to know how's the performance of 
                climbers in the USA. How hard the routes most of the climbers can send and is there are differences between male and female. Last but not least, I also want
                to know what are the factors can probably impact the climbing ability. The first factor came to my mind was height and weight. I want to use data to see if higher
                and thiner climber can have better performances.
            </p>
            <h3>Data Selection</h3>
            <p>
                I obtained the data from Kaggle. The owner of the project has scraped the data from <a href="https://www.8a.nu/" target="_blank">8a.nu</a>,
                a climbing community website where climbers can record their climbing achievements. I selected this data because it is probably the easiest way
                for me to get climbing data. Since climbing is still a niche sports, it is hard to find really comprehensive data.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I have to say this data set is inherently biased. The data comes from a website where users log their climbs and the people who will go to the 
                trouble of tracking this information on a website are very serious about their hobby. Hence, the data will suffer from self selection bias and 
                it will tend to over represent the serious, strong climber. 
            </p>
            <h3>Charts Design</h3>
            <p>
                To see where is the best place to climb in the US, I draw a choropleth map to show which states has more climbing routes. The darker the color, the more
                routes having in the area. Using a map here can tell clearly where are the best climbing area.
            </p>
            <p>
                For how many people sent in each grades, I choose a barchart and display the grade on x axis from low to high. It is easier for me to see which grade level are 
                sent by more people, are those grades easy or hard.
            </p>
            <p>
                I use bubble chart to show gender differences among climbers between male and female. The bubble size represents the highest level achieved by a climber.
                This picture clearly shows the difference between females and males in rock climbing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, I draw a box plot for both male and female with their best climbing grades and BMI. Box plot can not only show the trend of relationship between the two variables
                but also can tell the distribution of BMI in each grade level. 
            </p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                First of all, codes like choropleth graph and box plots are obtained from D3 galleries. When I was plotting my own charts based on the examples, I find it took time for
                me to understande their code and make appropriate changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                For data cleaning, since the data is scraped from website, there are some messy data. I had some back and force to obtain a fully cleaned dataset.
            </p>
            <p>
                Changing the layout is also hard for me. I'm not familiar with javascript and .css file. Sometime, I have no clue on how to place my chart in the place
                I want it to be.
            </p>

            <h3>Could be improved</h3>
            <p>
                (1) Using more charts to make my story more comprehensive.
                (2) Scraping data from "mountain project" (another rock climbing website) where I believe could be a better data source.
            </p>
